# BST 692 2020 Final

Your goal is to make a website that has information with your predictions on late-stage breast cancer.  You can organize the results in any way that makes sense to you but we will be evaluating your results based on your organization/presentation as well as the quality/rigor of your results.  Your target audience is smart people who don't know a lot about statistics.  The readers will likely be policy makers, key stakeholders in the community and doctors.  It is critical that you provide well written interpretations of your findings.  If written English is not a strength for you, work with others who can help you along.

In your solution we expect you to use at least one reactive dataset, at least one eventReactive control, and a couple of input functions.

# Tasks
## Describe the data

1. Put in a disclaimer on the landing page of the website saying that this work is done on simulated data inspired by patients seen in Miami. 
1. Describe the overall dataset
    + Include both interactive graphical and numeric summaries of all the variables in the entire dataset.
    + Allow users to look at the details of all the women or the women split by their city.
    
## Map the number of people without insurance 

1. Use the data that you pulled from the census and map it.

## Predict late-stage cancer using variables that are known before surgery
Build predictive models of late-stage breast cancer and provide the users with numeric and/or graphical summaries to help them understand what the models say/mean. Be sure to include at least these four modeling techniques:

1. KNN
1. Logistic Regression
1. Classification Tree
1. Random Forest

Your readers will *not* know these models.  Explain how they work in terms that a smart, but not mathematically sophisticated, person will understand. Describe their strengths and weaknesses. If you can find user friendly readings on the web, be sure to include links to those sources.

For each model, include any relevant information on important variables and specify how they impact the risk.

Have an overall statement about your ability to predict late-stage cancer.  Be sure to comment on statistical significance vs. practically/clinically significant findings.
